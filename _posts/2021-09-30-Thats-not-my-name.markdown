<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> chose this challenge for the writeup because of the need to have more information about this type of attack that has been increasing and with more sophisticated techniques every year. It’s a bit long to read but I think it’s worth it…. And yes, for those who are just looking for the solution to the challenge in the fastest way, there is also the section of the unintentional solution :).</p>
